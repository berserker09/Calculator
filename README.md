## How It Works ðŸ¤”
The calculator consists of two main parts:

Display: Shows the current calculation or result.
Keys: Buttons for numbers, operators, and other actions.
Weâ€™ve used CSS Grid to create the grid-like arrangement of keys. Each key has a data-action attribute that describes its purpose (e.g., addition, subtraction, etc.).
